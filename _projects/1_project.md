In sustainable agriculture requires the fast information about the condition of cultivated plants and the quick response to undesirable occurrences . For this purpose , we have built a drone (using Cost effective equipment) for monitoring & preventing field from any sort of damage.

<ul>
  <li>Protect the fields from animals, birds and other vulnerable lives by using automated alarming system.</li>
  <li>Inspect the crop health condition.</li>
  <li>Monitor the field with ESP-32 CAM module and send real time video.</li>
</ul>

<center><h4><b><u>Working Principle:</u></b></h4></center>

The drone is balanced by MPU-6050 Gyroscope. The camera shoots real time video and send it to a Laptop using Wi-Fi technology. Then the video is processed by python program in the laptop. If any animals, birds is detected, the alarming system is activated automatically.
