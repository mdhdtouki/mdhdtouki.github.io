  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  title={Atomistic investigations of mechanical properties and degradation rates of polycaprolactone blends with polylactic acid and polyglycolic acid},
  author={Hasan Douha Touki, Nayeem Uddin Ahmed, Mohammad Motalab∗ and Pritom Bose},
  abstract={Polycaprolactone (PCL) is a versatile biomaterial widely recognized for its biodegradability, non-toxicity, biocompatibility, and superior blending capability. However, its moderate mechanical strength often limits broader practical applications. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations were utilized to investigate enhancements in mechanical properties (Young’s modulus and ultimate tensile strength) and degradation kinetics of PCL through strategic blending with polyglycolic acid (PGA) and polylactic acid (PLA). Compositions studied included binary blends PCL/PGA (70/30) and PCL/PLA (70/30), as well as ternary blends PCL/PGA/PLA with ratios of (70/15/15), (60/20/20), and (50/25/25). PLA was selected due to its high stiffness and favorable thermal degradation properties, while PGA was chosen for its rapid degradation characteristics. The results demonstrated significant improvements; blending 30 wt% PGA into PCL notably increased ultimate tensile strength by 25.3% and Young’s modulus by 34.3%. Additionally, the hydrolytic degradation behaviors of neat PCL and its blends were examined in acidic (HCl) and basic (NaOH) environments using molecular simulations with explicit water molecules. The degradation rate in basic conditions (0.94 ns−1) was notably higher compared to acidic conditions (0.33 ns−1). Importantly, the ternary blend PCL/PLA/PGA (50/25/25) exhibited nearly double the degradation rate compared to pristine PCL. Thermal degradation studies, conducted through rapid heating (100 K/ps from 300 K to 3000 K), revealed the formation of primarily low-carbon molecules as end-products. Our simulation results offers crucial design guidelines for mechanical enhancement, controlled degradation, and biocompatibility optimization of PCL, which are critical for advancing its applications in biomedical engineering, including tissue scaffolding, drug delivery systems, resorbable surgical sutures, and sustainable packaging solutions.},

  title={Magnetohydrodynamics forced convective flow of micropolar ferrofluid over double stationary cylinders inside a vented chamber},
  author={Hasan Douha Touki, Nure Jannat Zubly, Sumon Saha*},
  abstract={This work delivers a comprehensive study on the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) forced convective circulation of micropolar ferrofluid over two static cylinders placed within a vented cavity. The cavity has an inlet port at the left bottom and an exit port at the right top. The bottom wall has a constant heat flux source, whereas the other two walls (except the cold right wall) and the cylinder’s surfaces are adiabatic. A constant magnetic field is induced horizontally at the right wall. This study seeks to optimize heat transfer by arranging the cylinders in various configurations under the given conditions, and it also contributes to optimizing heat transfer in various engineering and industrial applications, particularly in systems where fluid flow and magnetic fields influence thermal performance. The leading equations for MHD forced convection heat transport in the cavity are solved using the finite element method. Micropolar Fe3O4-water ferrofluid acts as the working fluid to capture additional fluid behavior at small scales, including micro-rotation and viscous impacts on the heat transport process. The system’s thermal effectiveness can be assessed by the average Nusselt number on the heated wall, mean ferrofluid temperature, pressure coefficient, and performance evaluation criterion. Those performance parameters are computed for three configurations of the cylinder-pair with the selected ranges of Reynolds number (1 ≤ Re ≤ 103), Hartman number (1 ≤ Ha ≤ 31.623), and material parameter (0 ≤ K ≤ 2) to understand the thermo-hydraulic characteristics. Upon extensive analysis, it is evident that the performance evaluation criterion varies significantly depending on the cylinder configurations. Heat transport in a cavity without a cylinder is less than in one with a cylinder pair at lower Reynolds numbers. The optimal horizontal position of the cylinder pair is three-fourths of the length of the cavity. The influence of the magnetic field on the average Nusselt number remains minimal across all Reynolds number ranges. Although the micropolar parameter has little effect at these lower Reynolds numbers, a rise in K leads to a decline in heat transport efficiency and an increase in pressure losses, adversely impacting thermal and hydraulic performance.},
