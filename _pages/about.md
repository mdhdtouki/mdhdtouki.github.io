Hi! I am a Ph.D. student in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at The George Washington University, where my research focuses on understanding the molecular dynamic behavior of water filtration membranes, particularly polyamide-based systems. My work aims to uncover the atomistic mechanisms that govern water transport, selectivity, and structural stability in advanced membrane materials — contributing to the development of more efficient and sustainable filtration technologies.

I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), where I developed a strong foundation in computational modeling, materials science, and thermal-fluid systems. My previous research includes studies on nanocomposites, polymer degradation, and micropolar ferrofluid flows, combining simulation and theoretical approaches to explore complex physical phenomena.

I am passionate about using molecular dynamics simulations and high-performance computing to bridge the gap between nanoscale insights and real-world material performance.
